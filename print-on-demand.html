<h2>Indie publisher</h2>
<p>Also called "small press" and "Independent press", are publishers rather than printers, if that is still a distinction?, this subject will get a chapter in time.</p>
<h2>Print-on-demand: fees and royalties.</h2>
<p>As an example Kindle Direct Publishing charges nothing to place your book in the storefront, but they share profits. When I last checked the author gets 60% in royalties (whats made on the sale) for normal distribution and 40% for expanded.</p>
<p>Ingramspark has lower royalties and a US$49 setup fee to upload a title.</p>
<p>Companies will offer pricing calculators.</p>
<p>Amazon competes at retail so Ingramspark may be more attractive if you are targeting stores.</p>
<p>My point is the options vary so be clear about your objectives and research thoroughly.</p>
<p>If you can make this decision early you may avoid rework be designing you product to the market place you are entering.</p>
<p>Some companies also offer print on demand in conjunction with packages that you have to buy first. These tend to be the pricier options. Bookbaby, for example, charges $399 for their package which allows distribution on sites like Amazon.</p>
<p>Where there is an online calculator I have priced a 84 page 8.5" x 5.5", or as near as I can find, Perfect bound B&amp;W on basic paper, which I present in a table like below. Please do you own test this is mid 2022, this will date.</p>

<p>Allow you to collaborate with editors and designers, but it allows stores and libraries to print books in-house using special printers. This basically takes out the middle man, or a retailer, and brings the book directly to the library or school ordering the book.</p>

<p>Like the name implies, 48hr Books gets your book ready to go between twenty-four and forty-eight hours. They have the option to print hardcover, and they have templates for authors to use if they’re unable to get their own formatting done. However, this company does require authors to order a minimum of ten books, which means it isn’t technically print-on-demand in the literal sense.</p>
